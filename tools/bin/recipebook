description = """recipebook creates a directed, acyclic graph (DAG) of Conda
recipes which allows us to sort them for building, ensuring those recipes that
are dependencies of others are build first.

Each node is a package name, version tuple and each edge represents a
dependency relationship. The graph is built by inspecting the meta.yaml files
in a set of Conda recipes. A topological sort of the graph provides a list of
packages and versions in an order suitable for building.

This used to be a capability of conda-build, which no longer supports
from-source build dependency calculation.
